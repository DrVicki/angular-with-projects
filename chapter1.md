# Chapter 1: Creating Your First Web Application in Angular 

Angular is a popular and modern JavaScript framework that can run on different platforms additional to the web, such as desktop and mobile. 
Angular applications are written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that provides syntactic sugar such as strong typing and object-oriented 
techniques. Angular applications are created and developed using a command-line tool made by the Angular team called the Angular CLI. It 
automates many development tasks, such as scaffolding, testing, and deploying an Angular application, which would take a lot of time to configure 
manually. The popularity of the Angular framework is considerably reflected in its broad support of tooling. The Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor 
contains various extensions that enhance the development experience when working with Angular. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics: 

  - Introduction to Angular 
  - Introduction to the Angular CLI Exploring the rich ecosystem of Angular tooling in VSCode How to create our first Angular application  
  - How to use Nx Console for automating Angular CLI commands
